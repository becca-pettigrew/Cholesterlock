				<h3>Michael S. Kallos</h1> <p>Doctor of Philosophy Chemical Engineering</p>
				<p class="hp_padding">We were not able to gather any information specifically on our protein but we were informed that the biochemistry modeling we had planned to do is usually something that would be tackled in an <b>entire thesis project</b>. Dr. Kallos suggested speaking to <b>Peter Tieleman</b> because he might be able to help us with his <b>expertise in lipids and membrane proteins</b>. This would be a computationally intensive project if we attempted to model everything before experimentation, for understanding the journey of our protein through intestinal mucus, we can use <b>Matlab</b> without needing computational fluid dynamics. Lots of molecules cross that layer, so we should research the characteristics of molecules that can pass (size, shape, etc.). He also suggested speaking to <b>Tina Rinker</b>, about more in depth information on <b>biological fluid simulations</b>. <br><br>We mentioned optimizing for just the protein instead of a probiotic to make expression easier, Dr. Kallos agreed and added that a <b>purified protein would make biosafety concerns less of a problem</b>. A good place to start would be to figure out whether the molecule can survive the path to the target area, and remain functional once it gets there. He also mentioned that <b>molecular simulations</b> can inform us at <b>which pH different bonds will unfold</b>. We also received contacts with <b>microbiology</b> experience at UCalgary such as <b>Cathy McCoy</b> and <b>Raylene Reimer</b> for future development. <br><br>Dr. Kallos mentioned that our <b>best option in future development</b> would be to bring questions to people working on <b>solution focused research</b>, as a lot of research being done focuses on investigating a problem. He also kindly offered to help us find the best people to get feedback from later on, and would love to continue collaborating with the <b>iGEM</b> team during the summer.</p>

				<h3>Robert Mayall</h1> <p>Ph.D.Physical Chemistry, Nanoscience and Electrochemistry</p>
				<p class="hp_padding">Robert, having worked as a <b>project manager on the 2013 FREDsense</b> iGEM team at the University of Calgary, informed us of his journey with the other co-founders as they transformed FREDsense from an iGEM project to a profit-making company. Being one of the first teams to transform their project entrepreneurially, they had to forge their own pathways by forming <b>novel networks</b> and <b>competing in other pitching competitions</b> in order to gain leverage for investment and garner technical validation to obtain more investors. With the money they raised, they were able to obtain a lab space outside the university and began working towards the production of field kits for efficient water analysis. Hearing about Robertâ€™s journey helped us visualize the steps we would need to take with Cholesterlock to go beyond iGEM and become a startup. <br><br>
					
					We were informed that as students, our commercialisation process with  Cholesterlock would begin with us contacting <b>Innovate Calgary</b>, then potentially <b>obtaining a patent</b>, and finally building networks that might help us in the industry. Innovate Calgary is the innovation company of UofC and they offer resources, facilities, and expert guidance that would be vital in bringing our project to life. We also discussed the importance of acquiring a patent as well as the value patents have in the industry especially for investors. Upon acquiring the necessary resources, we would then need to focus on scaling up our process and we discussed the reasons that would motivate the transfer from small volume bench scale reactors to larger vessels for commercial production. In order to meet a growing market, <b>scale up of our products</b> would be vital. Robert informed us that within the laboratory it is possible to grow up-to 4L of culture and the products can be placed in shaking incubators as FREDsense, for example,  only needs about 1 liter for all their other processes. Pertaining to volumes larger than this however, it would become difficult to evenly mix the culture, temperature distribution problems would arise and we would also need oxygen and stirrers for our processes.  The accumulation of all these problems would necessitate a <b>pilot scale bioreactor</b>, however, Robert advised us that we would be able to rent one from another company such as the technology translation plant in Concordia. <br><br>

					Beyond the entrepreneurial process, Robert <b>referred us to Dr. Justin MacCallum</b>, the Associate Dean in the Faculty of Science at the University of Calgary in order for us to discuss protein modeling and see what <b>computational tools</b> we would require.<br><br>

				<h3>Kristi Turton</h1> <p>Masters in Biochemistry</p>
				<p class="hp_padding">Our meeting with <b>Kristi</b> was beneficial in helping us navigate the next steps with our project with respect to the <b>Mindfuel prototyping competition</b> coming up in May. Moving forward, Kristi recommended that we should work towards finding an easy method to create a  <b>viable product</b>. However, given that obtaining a tangible product is something that might not be feasible within our set time frame, Kristi emphasized that our process would consist of <b>iterative talks</b> with HP contacts that would help guide our design process. By conducting more interviews and reaching out to experts in protein modeling we would become better informed of what our products would look like before ordering materials and we would be able to implement feedback that addresses challenges in our design. Kristi also recommended the use of quantitative methods such as <b>photometry</b> to help us generate graphs to help us determine protein function coupled with the use of dry lab to optimize and see how pH and temperature will affect the protein function. Lastly, we discussed how we would need to highlight the <b>weaknesses of existing solutions</b> to high cholesterol via the use of statistics and examples from clinical trials showing the side effects of these solutions in order to convey the <b>need for Cholesterlock</b>. <br><br>
					
					Overall, the meeting with Kristi was vital in providing our team with guidance on what the next steps should be for our reaction prototype. She advised that prior to our next meeting we should work on acquiring more HP contacts and utilizing these discussions to inform our designs and set up experiments, whilst keeping in mind all the <b>financial and experimental</b> <b>limitations.</b>
