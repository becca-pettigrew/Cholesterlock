				<h3>CoBiota</h5>
				<p class="lead" >According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, <b>nearly 2 in 5 adults suffer from high cholesterol levels.</b> This is especially significant since high cholesterol is the driving factor behind cardiovascular diseases and strokes due to the buildup of plaque in the arteries. However, <b>current medications for high cholesterol are burdened by adverse effects</b> that range from cumbersome to detrimental. The most common cholesterol-lowering medications, such as statins and ezetimibe, both cause patient discomfort and have been linked to drug-induced liver diseases. To provide a better alternative to these issues, we present <b>CholesterLock; a novel modified protein capable of lowering LDL cholesterol levels by inhibiting a mediator protein for cholesterol absorption called NPC1L1.</b>
