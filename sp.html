				<h3>CoBiota (McGill 2022) </h5>
				<p class="lead" >A probiotic that does not stay in the body (no colonization), another probiotic that lowers cholesterol by converting cholesterol to coprostanol in the gut, and this is not absorbed. So the cholesterol just gets excreted, and to do this they integrated a 3-part metabolic pathway into their bacterial chassis that expressed enzymes that jointly performed this. This is the same sort of concept being used by Cholesterlock, except, our project is attempting to inhibit a protein that plays a critical role in cholesterol absorption. Another difference between our projects is our design of using cell free systems for the protein production, and a purified protein delivery in pill form. Lastly, a difference between our projects revolves around the fact that reducing absorbed cholesterol levels alone has not been shown to lower LDL levels, but the inhibition of NPC1L1 has shown stronger results, so the outcome of our projects would be different too.

				<h3>Plaque Attack (University of Virginia 2022)</h5>
				<p class="lead" >The leading treatment to lower cholestrol have numerous side effects, so Plaque attack focused on TMAO (similar to the TPHS team) and bacteria capable of metabolizing the precursor to it cannot exist in the gut. Genetic modification could allow machinery to exist in the gut and clear cholesterol, so the team located relevant enzymes, made biobricks and designed a safety switch. The similarities between this project and ours, include the focus and end goal. In addition, both their use of probiotics and E.coli chassis as well as the possible use of cell free systems are experimental design elements Cholesterlock is investigating. Some differences: TMAO is not the focal piece of our design, the receptor NPC1L1 is. Another difference are the enzymes used in their biobrick, as ours would likely be a different set.

			<h3>TPHS (San Diego 2019)</h5>
			<p class="lead" >The purpose is to target and prevent the compound trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) from being produced in the body. There is a link between high concentatons of TMAO and increased risk for heart disease, likely because TMAO contributes to atherosclerosis by faciliaitng cholesterol hildup in the arteries. Several enzymes can convert TMAO to safer compounds, such as TMADH. Their plan was to have a bacterial system in E.coli to beak down the TMA and the toxic by product of its breakdown. Our project has a different target, and is utulizing a cell free system to produce the protein, and our project also wouldn’t result in any toxic compounds being produced that would have to be disposed of. Lastly, the protein would be delivered in a pill form in our case, and wouldn’t run the risk from the synthetically modified organism as TPHS.
